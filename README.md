* Project Description: 
	
	This project is a resale shop inventory app. A resale shop is a store that takes items from you and sells them and gives you some of the profit. I got this idea because my mom takes items to a resale shop that she doesn't want anymore. She told me they don't keep track of the things you take there. So she has to keep track of them herself by writing what she takes in a notebook. I thought I can make that easier for her.
	
	In this app users will be able to log in and keep track of what items they take to which resale shops. They can enter items into each specific list for each store. There will also be a section of the app that can keep track of monthly income. The user will be able to enter the amount of any check received from individual stores to see which store is making them the most money.
